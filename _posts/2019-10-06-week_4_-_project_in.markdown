Flatiron’s third week had just begun, the pace was hectic - overwhelming. Like a Hell Week of sorts. The amount of work I had cranked out is impressive to me even now after four weeks. If I could take time to do some review, I would be 20 lessons ahead of something that I thought was extremely hard previously. If I go back now, I can often pass tests in minutes that I spent hours on. I am genuinely proud of myself. 
The more code I write, the more confidence I gain.  I have found myself jumping in to help answer questions.  Even when I do not know the answer immediately, the challenge of trying to figure it out is very exciting.

Sometimes people get frustrated. They just want to be told the answer and, I get it. But I came here to do sit ups. Coding sit-ups that is. Navy Seal Jocko Willink says, there is no easy way. If you want to be better, be better. The short cut is a lie. Meaning, you need to do the work. My coding mentor says he isn’t that smart, (I disagree) that he just made a million mistakes and learned from them. 

Now that week four is over and my first major project is complete. I remember that It was only days ago I laughed at writing “puts ‘hello world’.” into the terminal. 

Minutes ago - I submitted a ruby gem that accesses one of my favorite websites and scrapes information that I am personally interested in. 

With the click of a button, my program shows me what inventory is out of stock and provides me with all the lowest priced items from categorie(s) that matter to me. It lets me open up the webpage of specific low-price items I want to buy right from the command line. It was 3 weeks ago that I was struggling to understand syntax.  Oh I forgot to mention that there is  additional secret functionality that “
“self-destructs” the app, displays terminal animation from a gif converted to ASCII, links to my previous projects, rick-rolls you if you try to access the hidden menu incorrectly, and has a hidden Easter egg referencing the first videogame I ever beat as a kid. 

Did I mention I just started to code a month ago?
