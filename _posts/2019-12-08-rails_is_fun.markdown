So far the rails project has been a great experience. I think I am use great in a literal heroic journey sense here. 

Encapsulating so many aspects of web development into once place is definately a trying experience. 


Before I could even get started my laptop suffered constant crashes from a MacOS Catalina conflict. It took 3 days to 

figure out, 3 resets of the OS to full resolve. I started the project a bit late because of it. I am on track to finish the base 

requirements within the proper 7 day time frame a few hours from now. I am happy that the MVP will be taken care of.  

Moving forward the biggest take away is UPDATE NOTHING. Let other people find the bugs in major software updates.

When you rely on your equipment for income do not take risks for the newest update. 


I kept running into an issue that really wasn't when I tried making sure my objects were updated  correctly. This lasted a 

long time until I realized I was using  find_by(params[:id]) instead of find or find_by_id. #SMH.
