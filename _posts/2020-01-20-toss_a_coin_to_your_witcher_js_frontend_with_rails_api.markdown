As the code dust settles from this latest project I asked myself:  "How have my projects and code improved?".

Over the winter break I coded non-stop gaining experience. When this project rolled around a few weeks later I had a much greater sense of confidence when approching the Frontend goals I set for myyself.

I manipulated html and css elements to produc a more attractive layout, customizing every aspect instead of leaving base raw html elements.  

The addition of JavaScript brought new life to  previously static text elements. With each action of user participation in the UI calculation values change on the fly and then update.

My sinatra project limped along. My first rails project began to walk. This prokect hopped out of bed made coffee and then went for a 3 mile run with its shirt off and posted it's realtion ship status as single on facebook.

I learned I couldnt call  - this.(whateverattribute) inside the console since I was in the scope of my class and needed to call properties on the specific object variable names. I used debugger and the console constantly. I learned I knew enough to help others with issues that I looked up to. That was a huge confidence booster.
